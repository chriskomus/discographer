Simon was working on [a=Purple Om] and Raja Ram was working with Graham Wood on The Infinity Project. The two went to the Glastonbury festival and decided to write something downtempo after their experience and Shpongle was born. \r\n\r\nThe Shpongle sound is a mix of mainly eastern ethnic samples and western contemporary psychedelic synth music. Posford is responsible for the synth and studio work while Raja Ram contributes with flute arrangements and creative sensibilities.", "urls": ["https://www.shponglemusic.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/shpongle", "https://myspace.com/therealshpongle/", "https://shponglemusic.bandcamp.com/"], "namevariations": ["Shpongle Duet", "Sphongle", "Spongle"], "members": [{"id": 57210, "name": "Simon Posford", "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/57210", "active": true}, {"id": 629636, "name": "Ron Rothfield", "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/629636", "active": true}], "data_quality": "Needs Vote"}
